## Mining NDVI Using Fuzzy-temporal Gradual Patterns: case of Kenya

### Description:
We first generate NDVI data from LANDSAT 7 images over Kenya through a novel tool known as data-cube. The data-cube is a great tool for the expanded use of satellite data in an Open Source framework, see also https://www.opendatacube.org. Then, we apply our algorithm on the NDVI data and we extract the fuzzy-temporal gradual patterns.
